Most debates, arguments, etc. are characterized by two people who think they're right, telling the other person why they're wrong.

What if we were to cultivate the exact opposite disposition:

Wanting to be wrong.

A mindset of "wanting to be wrong" creates a setting for others disagree with us -- _inviting_, not rejecting, those disagreements -- and allows us the needs expressed by those who disagree (NVC) and their counterpoints in the best possible light ("Steel-manning").

But why would we _want to_ be wrong?

Because someone proves us wrong about an idea we have, possible strategy, attitude, stance, etc., they've done us a massive favor: they've helped us avoid a misstep, and the misspending of the precious limited resources we have in the forms of time, energy, momentum, and attention.

Defaulting to "wanting to be wrong" helps us root out dogma, and creates opportunities for the best possible ideas to surface.
