Have some pieces to add to our theses? We know we're _a few_ shy of 95 (not that it's a competition, Martin!).

What would you add to our _Disputation on the Power of Social Justice Dogma_? What theses are we missing?

Or what do we need to agree upon in order to step out of the story of SJD and into a story of Living Social Justice, minus dogma?
