You now have <del>9</del>5 theses (and one grand conclusion) that you can take to your Wittenberg for disputation. And we invite you to do that before you finish up this Module:

```
Talk through the individual theses from this Module with your accountabilibuddy, set up a dinner with some social justice friends, start an email thread with close colleagues -- whatever your Wittenberg looks like. Invite dispute. Welcome it! Let's figure out why and how we're wrong here.
```

Here they are all together for your convenience:

1. Social justice is both a means and an end, and any action we take in its name should be guided by a compass pointing toward equity.
2. In order to accomplish the goals of social justice, we must achieve change on a system level; efforts spent on the individual level — removing, replacing, or excoriating individual actors within a system — are misspent, ignore the ways injustice affects us all, and are often advantageous for the system itself.
3. Any efforts must translate to our living world, with all ramifications considered, be actionable, and have their efficacy judged by their ability to achieve justice.
4. In order to align our efforts, and best utilize our collective resources, we must invite discourse and discursivity within the social justice movement to determine the paths forward.
5. Social justice is equity for all, and therefore no individual or social group should be excluded from any intended progress, or left out of the conversation about how to get there.
6. If we recognize that any step toward equity must reflect its characteristics, we will find confidence that living social justice – and not merely enacting dogma – is both process and outcome.
