What is living social justice, as opposed to social justice dogma?

At the risk of being _too_ dichotomous, here are some conclusions we're wrestling with (maybe you landed in similar places during your Wittenberg convo):

> Social justice dogma is certain; **living social justice is being unsure.**

> Social justice dogma is having all the answers; **living social justice is asking questions.**

> Social justice dogma is comfort at the expense of real community; **living social justice is real community forged through discomfort.**

> Social justice dogma is doing what we're told to do; **living social justice is telling a new story of what are capable of.**
