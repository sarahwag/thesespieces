The first part of this thesis can be pretty well summed up in this famous quote spoken by [Lilla Watson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilla_Watson), an idea that originated from an aboriginal activists group in Queensland in the 1970s:

>"If you have come here to help me, you are wasting your time. But if you have come because your liberation is bound up with mine, then let us work together."

If we recognize the different ways oppression affects us all, and how our liberations are bound together, we're driven to collective action. But what role should we play?
