When Sam Killermann started writing about ["social justice dogma" in 2017](https://www.itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2017/12/introduction-social-justice-dogma/), a fellow activist replied, "Nail your 95 theses to the door and let's get on with it."

In the two years since, Sam, and the other facilitators and contributors to Social Justice, Minus Dogma, have been exploring what those 95 theses might be. This course has, thus far, paralleled that process.

In this Module, we'll be continuing in that direction. We're going to try to figure out what we'd nail to the door of our hypothetical "Church."
