Grab your hammer and a few nails. We're going to be drafting up our <del>9</del>5 theses, or -- if we wanted to be fancy -- our Disputation on the Power of Social Justice Dogma.

And after this Module, we're going to be finding some doors to nail it to.

**Let's start with hearing from you, right now, about the doors in your neighborhood.**

<small>Tell us what pops into your mind when faced with the idea of bringing everything we've been discussing here into your real life ðŸ‘‡</small>
