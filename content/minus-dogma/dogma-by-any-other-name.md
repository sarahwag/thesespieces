While "Social Justice Dogma" is the phrase we've been using (as coined by Sam in that linked post), this same idea goes by many other names. For example, read this blog post by Frances Lee about the "Church of Social Justice":

People also refer to SJD with some play on the word "Woke" (e.g., "Woke-ism", "Woke Olympics"), or in a variety of other ways. In this course, **we're using SJD as a shorthand to refer to a special kind of fundamentalism that is prevalent within the social justice movement.**

Anyone else who is talking about that -- regardless of what name they use -- is talking about what we're talking about. We don't need to be nit-picky about what we call it.

After all, [a dogma by any other name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_rose_by_any_other_name_would_smell_as_sweet) would still smell.
