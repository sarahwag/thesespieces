Reverend Martin Luther, objecting to the church's selling of indulgences, nailed his [95 Theses](https://www.luther.de/en/95thesen.html) to the door of the Castle Church on October 31, 1517 -- or [so the legend goes](https://www.luther.de/en/legenden/tanschl.html).

His "Disputation on the Power of Indulgences" began:

> "Out of love for the truth and from desire to elucidate it, the Reverend Father Martin Luther, Master of Arts and Sacred Theology, and ordinary lecturer therein at Wittenberg, intends to defend the following statements and to dispute on them in that place."

He followed with 95 statements, all invitations for discussion, where he built his case against the doctrine of indulgences ([here's a summary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninety-five_Theses#Content), for the historically curious).
