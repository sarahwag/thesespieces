The "Minus" is why we're here. It's what we're gathered around. We're here _for_ social justice, _minus_ dogma. Minus fundamentalism.

So that's what we'd need to nail to our door. Or at least we'd have to include it, right?

Any theses we might hammer to the door of the Church of Social Justice would need to speak to how we can remove the dogma -- unravel the fundamentalism -- to clear a path forward toward living social justice.

Not _in spite of_ social justice, the Social Justice Movement, or the [Acolytes of SJD](https://acolytes.course.sjmd.space) -- indeed, to borrow a phrase from Martin Luther, we are doing so **out of love for social justice and the desire to achieve it.**
