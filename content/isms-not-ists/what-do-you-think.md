Does this thesis make sense to you? Seem to hold some truth?

>In order to accomplish the goals of social justice, we must achieve change on a system level; efforts spent on the individual level — removing, replacing, or excoriating individual actors within a system — are misspent, ignore the ways injustice affects us all, and are often advantageous for the system itself.

Is there another foundation we need to build instead? Something about this you take issue with?
