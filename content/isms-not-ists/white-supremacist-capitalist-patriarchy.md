bell hooks has helped a lot of us think about -- and _speak directly about_ -- the systems that work together to enact oppression.

[Here's an interview](https://www.mediaed.org/transcripts/Bell-Hooks-Transcript.pdf) where she was asked why she (famously) uses the phrase "White supremacist capitalist patriarchy," and this was the beginning of her reply:

> "I began to use the phrase in my work “white supremacist capitalist patriarchy” because I wanted to have some language that would actually remind us continually of the interlocking systems of domination that define our reality and not to just have one thing be like, you know, gender is the important issue, race is the important issue, but for me the use of that particular jargonistic phrase was a way, a sort of short cut way of saying all of these things actually are functioning simultaneously at all times in our lives and that if I really want to understand what's happening to me, right now at this moment in my life, as a black female of a certain age group, I won't be able to understand it if I'm only looking through the lens of race. I won't be able to understand it if I'm only looking through the lens of gender. I won't be able to understand it if I'm only looking at how white people see me."
