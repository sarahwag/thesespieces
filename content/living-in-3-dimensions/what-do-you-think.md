Does this thesis make sense to you? Seem to hold some truth?

>Any efforts for social justice must translate to our living world, with all ramifications considered, be actionable, and have their efficacy judged by their ability to achieve justice.

Is there another foundation we need to build instead? Something about this you take issue with?
