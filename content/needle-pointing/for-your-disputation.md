At the beginning of this topic, "Needle Pointing", we have a thesis for your disputation:

> "Social justice is both a means and an end, and any action we take in its name should be guided by a compass pointing toward equity."

This will be true for the next few topics in this module as well. We hope this goes without saying at this point, but like everything else in this course, please don't take it (or any of the other theses) as gospel, but vet it yourself.
