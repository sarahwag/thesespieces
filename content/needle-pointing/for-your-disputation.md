At the beginning of this topic, "Needle Pointing", we have a thesis for your disputation:

> "Social justice is both a means and an end, and any action we take in its name should be guided by a compass pointing toward equity."

This will be true for the next few topics in this module as well. We hope this goes without saying at this point, but like everything else in this course, please don't take it (or any of the other theses) as gospel, but vet it yourself.

Do you agree with this thesis? With the idea so far? Do you have hangups? Disagreements? Suggestions or alterations? Let us know in [the community](https://community.sjmd.space/c/course/module-5), our shared equivalent of Luther's Wittenberg.

<small>For the rest of this Module, all of the discuss links will take you to a single thread for that topic/thesis. If you want to start additional threads for discussing specific readings or linked resources, just say so!</small>
