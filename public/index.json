This course has, thus far, paralleled that process.\nIn this Module, we\u0026rsquo;ll be continuing in that direction.

For example, read this blog post by Frances Lee about the \u0026ldquo;Church of Social Justice\u0026rdquo;:\n   BLOG: Excommunicate Me from the Church of Social Justice / Frances Lee  People also refer to SJD with some play on the word \u0026ldquo;Woke\u0026rdquo; (e.g., \u0026ldquo;Woke-ism\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Woke Olympics\u0026rdquo;), or in a variety of other ways. In this course, we\u0026rsquo;re using SJD as a shorthand to refer to a special kind of fundamentalism that is prevalent within the social justice movement.\nAnyone else who is talking about that \u0026ndash; regardless of what name they use \u0026ndash; is talking about what we\u0026rsquo;re talking about.
